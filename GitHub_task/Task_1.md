In the first task we had to basically create a repo on the github organization then add a hello world file using our terminal

the commands i used are:
1.firstly initialized the folder using "git init"
2.git add
3.git commit
4. git remote add origin - this was to set the repo i was uploading my files to
5.git push -u origin master
